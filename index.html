                    Hi there! My name is Thang and welcome to my portfolio! This website is dedicated to showcasing my achievements alongside the extracurricular activities that I’ve been a part of for the duration of my highschool and the gap year that I took. 
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to the purely academic materials and awards, the site will also include other sections and contents that would ultimately aid you in better understanding who I am; not only as an academic student but also as a person. Feel free to navigate around and I hope that this would make your evaluation process a bit more amusing.

                    Before you dive deeper into my portfolio, I’d like to briefly introduce myself. Once again, I’m Thang, or you may refer to me as David, my nickname. I was born and raised in Saigon in a relatively comfortable household. Both my parents were very open-minded about my upbringing: allowing me to take upon the path that best suits me. It took a while for me to find out what's right but here I am as an aspiring software engineer and entrepreneur.
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up, I’ve developed a small but consistent list of hobbies including basketball, artcraft, weight-lifting, running, and more recently, web-development and engaging in random coding projects. In addition, I’ve always had an entrepreneurship passion within me similar to that of my parents who founded their startup. I was able to witness their entrepreneur path grow from an idea to a flourishing business: a journey I’ve come to admire and thrive for. The me as of the moment is still young and naive. The journey I’ve got ahead of me is long but I hope to realize my entrepeniship dream 10 years down the road by establishing my own software firm. I may not be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, but as the saying goes:“aim for the moon. If you miss, you’ll land among the stars”.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of the day, I strive to be the best version of myself and run as far as I can in the race we call “life”. Whether my dreams are realized or not, I shall give it a shot with everything I’ve got as I’ve only got one lifetime to do it anyway.

                        <p>
                            For the majority of my academic career, I’ve been an achievement-oriented student. This semester, for me, was the first time I hadn’t made the honor roll. The transition to highschool initially hadn’t been demanding. I managed fairly well in the first semester and had placed myself on the Distinguished Honor Roll, but as the year progressed, the sheer abundance of distractions got the better of me. I found myself drifting away and indulging in distractions far too often. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As is my habit, whenever I am surprised or disappointed by an outcome, I self-reflect and seek to learn something from it.  This experience served as a reminder of what I needed to focus on and what sorts of stimuli my life would be better without. I promised myself that I would not let an incident like this occur again, and I kept that promise throughout my high school years. I think for many, excellence in one’s academic records is a reflection of their intellect. As I see it, it is more a reflection of one’s work ethic and determination. Getting good grades for me was a form of validation; it was proof that, regardless of what my innate abilities were, the key to success was tenacity and consistency.

                        </p>

As a result, most of my childhood days were spent indulging in the sport; refining my dribbling and shooting skills in hopes that one day my basketball dreams would be realized. I’ve consistently been a part of my school’s basketball team since 5th grade, and it has been an enormously satisfying experience for me. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By the time I made it to high school, my schedule had become increasingly intense. As a compromise, I went out for the B Team- this allowed me to balance both my academic goals and the sport I was so passionate about. Being part of a sports team has always been thrilling and exciting. I am very much looking forward to playing team sports at RMIT in the upcoming year.

                            From the perspective of a 9th grader, Model United Nation was petrifying. Imagine, if you will, standing in front of maybe 50 strangers in a conference room getting ready to deliver your argument in support of a newly added amendment to a resolution paper. As you’re presenting, thoughts shoot through your head in all sorts of directions. You wonder if the next speaker will shred your argument with their counter-argument and you’ll be left speechless. You wonder if your argument is even valid: was your research solid? Were you prepared for the fusillade of POIs (Points of Inquiry) aimed directly at your soft spots? It is truly a mentally taxing experience, but one that I found to be extremely helpful in that it allowed me to develop skillsI truly couldn’t have obtained anywhere else.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            For a certainty, it was at these conferences that I learned how to deliver strong arguments in a confident and concise manner; to communicate and work effectively with others to come up with resolutions to real world issues; to build confidence in my research.

                            UNISMUN (United Nation International School Model United Nation) was undoubtedly one of my most memorable MUN (Model United Nations) experiences at UNIS of Hanoi. As one of the most distinguished highschool MUN conference hosts, the competition at this event was beyond that of any other I had been a part of, before or since. For the same reason, it was also where I most improved as a delegate- the fierce competition drove me to work harder and further fueled my naturally competitive nature.

                            UNIS was diverse; much more so than any other MUN environment or even international environment in Vietnam. My brief time at UNIS was as eye opening as it was intellectually stimulating. I was able to learn from so many diverse perspectives about a myriad of things. It was interesting to see how other delegates handled different situations, particularly in regards to their country’s standings. Perhaps the most enriching thing about UNIS- and with many other MUN conferences- is that you’re exposed to extremely passionate and dedicated students who, in all likelihood, will be captains of industry and politics. While the debates were deeply entertaining, my favorite part was during the resolution process where most of the collaborative work and critical thinking took place.

                            It is commonly believed- in the US, anyway- that your Junior year will be an arduous one; perhaps the most challenging considering that only the first semester of 12th grade will be evaluated by the time our college applications are submitted. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In my case, that couldn’t have been more true. Studying abroad, away from the comforts of your own home is certainly challenging but it also has its perks. Initially, my experience was depressing: I had trouble socializing and connecting with my American peers. Many of my interests, values, and priorities were unrelatable to the people around me. Finding the right group to align with in a seeming torrent of hundreds of new faces was overwhelming. However, getting accustomed to the extreme weather of Iowa, the people, and my new life was a rewarding journey, nonetheless.  I developed a capacity for patience that I never knew I could have, I cultivated the ability to approach things with a more open-mind, and most importantly, the confidence to adapt and overcome, all of which are traits that complimented my determination and ambition. As a result, my Junior year became one of my best performing years throughout my highschool experience while also being my most difficult year.

                            As a child growing up, I’ve always been exuberant about science. For a large portion of my middle school years, I was captivated by the field of Astronomy. From the formation of Earth to extraterrestrial phenomena such as blackholes and antimatter, I’ve always been intrigued by the natural development of the universe and how minuscule we humans are relative to the universe as we know it.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            On a much smaller and immediate scale, if we take a look around us we notice that our current development as a species has been heavily influenced by our scientific discoveries and continual explorations within the STEM field. I was particularly invested in Biology and Biochemistry- I had, after all, began studying AP biology as early as 9th grade. By 11th grade, I decided to enroll in 3 science classes: AP Chemistry, SLU (St. Louis University) Biology, and Honors Human Anatomy; all of which were classes that compliment each other in a way that allowed me to better comprehend the materials in toto. My academic performance in these three classes earned me the Bausch + Lomb Honorary Science Award: a reflection of my genuine interest in science and one of my proudest academic achievements to date. The adrenaline and exhilaration I experienced from connecting the dots and fully understanding these subjects holistically was unparalleled. Learning new concepts now is just as exciting as it was 3 years ago.

                        <p>
                            One of the biggest cultural shocks for me while transitioning to studying abroad was the sheer difference in the athleticism amongst students. The athletes at Xavier High School were superior in terms of stamina, strength, and size when compared to my former classmates back in Vietnam. As a result, the competition was much more intense- many of these kids had been playing basketball since 4th grade and attending summer sports camps for years- and I was no longer anywhere near a star player.  However, I did learn how to play a support role and improve my passing game quite a bit.  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Still craving competition, I sought a different sport where my opponents would be more my size and skill-level: wrestling. Wrestling was a much more physically demanding sport than basketball. My experiences on the wrestling team were extremely challenging. We trained 5 times a week: each session lasting up to 3 hours of tackling one another to the floor, lifting weights, performing drills, learning techniques and stances, and a tremendous amount of cardio. The exercises would gradually become a routine and the routine, in turn, became habit. It is thanks to wrestling that I still consistently lift-weights today. Although I didn’t manage to perform particularly well as a wrestler, (most of my matches being losses), I left the team as the best athlete I’ve ever been.

                        <p>
                            Upon setting foot in the States, one of the things I looked forward to was the MUN experience. I wondered how it would differ from that of Vietnam. Having heard about it from a couple friends, I was under the impression that it would be more challenging as the conferences are much larger and hence would entail a higher level of competition.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            That said, despite the fact that ISHMUN was bigger in terms of the number of participants, it wasn’t necessarily more competitive but rather the opposite. Delegates and chairs were more relaxed. We weren’t required to follow strict guidelines and speech protocols which had been required in the conferences that I was a part of in Vietnam. Each conference had up to 100 people and each country was assigned 2 delegates: in order words, I had a partner. In addition, the resolution drafting process was also different insomuch that the delegates would draft and debate simultaneously. Although different, this setup was easier to manage as I had a partner to aid me through the process. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            By speaking in front of a much larger, unfamiliar, crowd, I was able to build greater confidence in my public speaking abilities. The diversity in the group of participants also enabled me to interact with not only high school students within the local region but also from MUN enthusiasts from all across Iowa.

                        <p>
                            My experience Senior year was truly unique in that it adhered to the Montessori method of education; New Gate Montessori.  It was here that I worked toward my IB degree. In short, the Montessori method places heavy emphasis on enabling students to develop the ability to independently learn and self-initiate. As a result, not only were the roles/responsibilities of teachers and students different, but also the learning environment, grading system and nearly everything else you might imagine. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Similarly to my transitioning experience between my sophomore year and Junior year, it was difficult at first to adjust to, once again, another environment. However as the year progressed, I gradually learned to enjoy the Montessori method. The relationship between students and teachers was more of a friendship/mentorship. Students were encouraged to take their learning at their own pace. Independence was heavily emphasized and I enjoyed the freedom to learn in whatever manner that I wished. It was at New Gate that, for the first time, I felt connected with my teachers and my peers while studying abroad. Eventually, my perception of New Gate was no longer that of a narrow, traditional school but rather that of an environment for me to flourish in academically and mature as an individual. It was this disintegration of my perception of New Gate as a school that empowered me to perform as well as I did. Although I am proud of my perfect GPA, it cannot solely be attributed to my work ethic, but rather to my teachers' relentless support and attentiveness and the competitiveness and dedication of my peers which ultimately served as a source of motivation. The largest factor in regards to my success, however, was the welcoming and home-like atmosphere that I found at New Gate.

                        <p>
                            While the years leading up to my 12th Grade experience had been academically challenging, I had yet to garner any work experience. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I needed an opportunity to dive deeper into the field of marketing: particularly, digital marketing; an opportunity that could best serve as a learning experience while also giving me the freedom to experiment, engage in meaningful activities, and partake in the operations of an actual workplace. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Fortunately for me, I found the perfect opportunity to intern at Crosby Counseling Center: a small, local mental health clinic. Crosby Counselling Center did not have a marketing team and their marketing efforts were uncoordinated and largely unmanaged. Initially, I was given the role of an assistant office manager where I made callbacks, arranging scheduling for counsellors and participating in meetings. As I familiarized myself with the industry by gaining a deeper understanding of the customers and the services that we provided, I developed a plan to completely redo the entirety of their marketing strategy.  I spent weeks planning.  Finally, I approached Dr. Crosby and made my pitch.  She scheduled a meeting and I did a formal presentation of my marketing strategy.  She was impressed and okayed a metered roll-out of my plan.  Collecting consumer data for the kind of company that Crosby Counseling Center is was difficult due to the sensitive nature of mental health work and the diversity of the counseling services offered. As per the plan, I initially worked on collecting more data to support any initiatives I would choose and started out with an emphasis on cost-efficacy. Together with the counselors, we began running ad campaigns on social media and building our counselor profiles on sites such as Bark, Thervo, and Psychology Today.

                            At the time, the largest and cheapest-to-solve problem was that we lacked a website to link to. The task of building a website was initially an overwhelming proposal and required an extensive list of prerequisite skills to even begin building.  I resolved to build the website and began the process of learning wordpress, a content-management system. Learning wordpress, consulting with the counselors regarding the content of the page and putting a functional site together took me 2 months. The experience, for me, was one filled with elation and ecstasy. I was given the opportunity to do something meaningful in the field of digital marketing while taking real-world actions that could have real-world impacts. By devising my own strategy to stimulate the business’s marketing efforts I had an incredibly meaningful experience that allowed me to learn a great deal in a very short time.

                            At the height of its value, a single Bitcoin was worth $64,000. Given that Digital Currencies have no intrinsic value, their enormous and (sometimes) baffling appreciation demands a second look. For a portion of my gap year, I was heavily invested in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink, and Cardano. Aside from their role as an alternative to fiat currencies, the large variety of coins listed on the market offers other utility. Take Ethereum, for instance: beyond being one of the most highly valued cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is also a technology platform that allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts: business contracts that act as an intermediary between 2 business partners. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            While actively investing in and studying Cryptocurrencies, I was focusing on the building blocks behind it. Please find, attached to the bottom of this section, several links to my research and documentation.  It was interesting to see the potential behind the decentralized transactional ledger that bitcoin utilizes, and its impact on the financial industry. It is truly as Don Tapscott, the writer of “Blockchain Revolution”, says: the internet of things has now become the internet of value.  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I was intrigued by the rise in popularity of Blockchain development and decided to investigate another blockchain similar to Bitcoin: Ethereum. Ethereum smart contract development for an inexperienced developer such as myself was difficult, as the field is still relatively new and resources detailing smart contract development are limited.  Fortunately, I found a Udemy course that guided me on building my first contract and deploying on one of Ethereum’s test networks: the Rinkeby network. I was also introduced to the javascript testing environment, Mocha, to test my contracts before deploying them. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The world of cryptocurrency and blockchain is still in its infancy but it is growing at an exponential rate. The decentralized nature of blockchains and its impenetrable security via consensus mechanisms such as PoW (Proof-of-Work) or PoS (Proof-of-Stake) is truly groundbreaking. With decentralized currency growing in popularity, banks and centralized financial institutions are on the verge of undergoing potentially world-altering changes in the near future. Other areas such as the medical field, governmental bodies, and security related services can also greatly benefit from this new technology. Whatever the future may hold, I am excited to see the development of Blockchain and its implementations in the years to come.

                        <p>
                            After graduating highschool, I enrolled in a series of online courses under the Entrepreneurship Specialization offered by Wharton’s School of Business on Coursera. The four courses that fall under the specialization are: Developing the Opportunity, Launching your Start-Up, Growth Strategies, and Financing and Profitability. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            It is through these courses that I learned about the pathways to becoming an entrepreneur: to be able to identify opportunity, create scalable business models, quickly expand your startup, and financially support your venture. The primary goal of the course was to provide me with the methods and tools to reduce risk and increase one’s chances for success. Each startup is unique and requires its own, novel approach- tailored for the startup itself. As such, there was no single recipe for a successful startup but rather a series of precautions and strategies to best maximize one’s resources and make the most of the opportunities that you have.  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The specialization courses have been an enlightening experience as they expanded on what I had known previously about entrepreneurship and business. More importantly, the specialization has endowed me with confidence in my own abilities and the motivation to start a venture of my own when the right time presents itself. Below are attached links to each course’s respective certification.

                            Below are some other online courses that I have also taken through the duration of my gap year. Each and every one of the courses below has been extremely useful and edifying for me. Regarding the CS50 course, it was a free class offered by Harvard. Students can optionally pay for a certificate. I took it as an introductory course to programming before I jumped into Python and web development.

                            Python was one of the first programming languages that I learned due to its simple syntax and popularity. I was introduced to Python through Harvard’s CS50 course and through a couple of my friends who were studying abroad at the time. The programming world can be extremely overwhelming for a beginner with no guidance. In addition to the introductory lectures on Python in the CS50 course, I also enrolled in 2 other Python courses on Coursera where I learned about the basics of Python programming and Python data structures.

                        <p>
                            During the summer of 2020, after my highschool graduation, I was enrolled in the Entrepreneurship Specialization Program offered by UPENN (University of Pennsylvania) on Coursera, an online course platform. The specialization was divided into 4 courses: Developing the Opportunity, Launching your Start-Up, Growth Strategies, and Financing and Profitability. These courses were spectacular in that they had a lot of useful materials and external links to other resources for further learning. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            At the time, I had wanted to take a gap year for 2 reasons: the first being the pandemic and the second being that I wanted to explore my major interests before committing to them during university. Right after finishing the specialization course, I had an amazing start-up idea that had great potential. That was how TKGS came to life with the help of 3 others who were part of my founding team. TKGS stood for ‘Tim Kim Gia Su’, translating to ‘Finding your Tutor”. The idea was to connect tutors with students with matching needs and qualifications in a similar fashion to Uber or Grab-Bike. Traditionally, personal tutors that are qualified and can be trusted are difficult to find: in most cases, they are discovered primarily through word of mouth. In other cases, the tutoring services that students look for are often very niche and it can be difficult to find a tutor (for example: Learning to speak  swedish). Further, the app wasn’t just limited to qualified tutors but also freelance tutors which would provide enormous opportunities to students looking to make extra income by leveraging their hard-earned skills.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Our team consisted of 4 people including myself. I was responsible for our marketing efforts and the main business operations along with Hung. The other two, Phuc and Huy, were responsible for web/app development. The planning process took a considerable amount of time as we were focusing on establishing our brand identity and what our customer demographics were. You can check the link at the bottom to view our progress. Our business model offers the service free for the students/parents while the tutors are charged a fixed fee for each referral. The value for users on both ends is the intermediary platform itself to connect the two (a two-sided-market model).  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As with any entrepreneurship venture, it comes with its challenges. One of our biggest challenges was working together effectively as a team. We had a lot of internal conflict regarding who the targeted customers should be and the design and functionality of the website. In addition, much to our chagrin, we later found that our team lacked the necessary skill-sets to develop the back-end of the site with a functional, dynamic database. I have come to understand that a founding team must be solid for a company to endure the trials of its own creation and implementation. We didn’t have the right combination of talents and thus we disbanded. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Through this experience and after some careful consideration, I decided it was best to pursue a career in tech before pursuing my ultimate dream- developing a tech-related firm. As part of this goal, I created a self-study course to learn programming and web-development in order to better familiarize myself with the programming world. As a matter of fact, this very website which you are currently reading represents the fruits of my efforts over the last couple of months. While I currently lack the skills to develop the applications that I wish to create, I am diligently working to build a foundation on which the things I envision can be built. Over the course of the next 3 years at RMIT, I hope to not only improve as a developer but also to meet other passionate and talented students to learn and work with.
